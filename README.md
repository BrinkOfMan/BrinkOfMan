- Hello! I’m @BrinkOfMan, AKA Ethan Brinkman, or just Brinkman if you're into calling people by their last names.

- I’m currently finishing my Computer Science and Psychology degree from St. Olaf College, and hoping to land an intern or entry-level software position after graduation.

- This profile largely functions as an archive for past school and personal archives I've created since I started writing code back in 2018.

- If you'd like to reach out to me for things related to GitHub (collaboration, clarification on repositories, use of projects), feel free to email me at brinkmanethan@gmail.com OR brinkm1@stolaf.edu

- If you'd like to reach out to me for a possible software developer position, both previous emails are welcome, or you can connect via linkedin at linkedin.com/in/ethanbrinkman/

- Stay hydrated, and thanks for checking this profile out!
