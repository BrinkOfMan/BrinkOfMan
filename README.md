- Hello! I’m @BrinkOfMan, AKA Ethan Brinkman, or just Brinkman if you're into calling people by their last names.

- I’m a Cum Laude graduate in Computer Science and Psychology from St. Olaf College, currently searching for an intern or entry-level software development position.

- This profile largely functions as an archive for past school and personal projects I've created since I started seriously writing code in 2018.

- If you'd like to reach out to me for things related to GitHub (collaboration, clarification on repositories, use of projects), feel free to email me at brinkmanethan@gmail.com ~~OR brinkm1@stolaf.edu (school e-mail)~~ instead of my deactivated school email.

- If you'd like to reach out to me for a possible software developer position, emails are welcome, or you can connect via linkedin at https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethanbrinkman/ and send a message there.

- Stay hydrated!
